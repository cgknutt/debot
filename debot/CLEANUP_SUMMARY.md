# Xcode Project Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the cleanup actions performed on the debot Xcode project to fix various warnings and issues.

## Fixed Issues

### Sandbox Permission Errors
- Removed problematic `find` commands from Run Script phases that were causing sandbox permission issues.
- Created `comprehensive_fix.sh` to fix these issues across the project.
- Developed `sandbox_safe_cleanup.sh` that avoids the use of `find` commands.

### Run Script Phase Warning
- Created `fix_script_phase.sh` to improve dependency analysis settings for all Run Script phases.
- Added `outputFileListPaths`, set `alwaysOutOfDate = 0` to enable dependency analysis.
- Updated all script phases to properly declare their output paths, fixing the "Run script phase uses neither input nor output file lists and will run on every clean build" warning.

### Deprecated API Warnings (iOS 17.0)
- Addressed several APIs deprecated in iOS 17.0:
  - Updated `applicationIconBadgeNumber` usage in `debotApp.swift`
  - Fixed `onChange(of:)` to use the single-parameter version in multiple files:
    - `debotApp.swift`: Updated to use `onChange(of:) { newValue in ... }`
    - `FlightSearchView.swift`: Updated throughout, including in the `ThemeSelector` struct
  - Updated `Maps` initializers in `FlightSearchView.swift` to use proper API
  - Fixed incorrect Model property access (`departureAirport` and `arrivalAirport`) in `FlightSearchView.swift`
  - Added required title parameter to `Annotation` initializers in:
    - `FlightSearchView.swift`: Added "Departure" and "Arrival" titles to map annotations
    - `FlightMapView.swift`: Used flight number as the annotation title

### Variable Declaration Warnings
- Changed `var` to `let` for immutable variables in:
  - `SlackAPI.swift`
  - `MockFlightDataService.swift`: Changed `var depIndex` to `let depIndex`
- Fixed unused immutable values in `SlackMessagesView.swift` by replacing `let result =` with `_ =` in API calls

### Color Asset Conflict
- Renamed the "Primary" color asset to "AppPrimary" to resolve naming conflicts
- Updated references in `Theme.swift`
- Created and executed `rename_color_asset.sh` to duplicate the color asset with the new name

### Slack Connection Issues
- Enhanced error handling and diagnostics in the Slack API integration:
  - Added detailed debugging output in `SlackViewModel.testAPIConnection()` to identify connection issues
  - Improved token validation to detect placeholder tokens
  - Created `setup_slack_token.sh` script to simplify the token configuration process
  - Made `botToken` and `getConfigFileURL` methods accessible for better diagnostics
  - Added comprehensive setup instructions to the README.md file
  - The token is now verified to ensure it starts with 'xoxb-' (Bot token format)

## Next Steps

1. Restart Xcode after applying all the changes
2. Clean the build folder (Product > Clean Build Folder)
3. Build the project to verify that all warnings have been resolved
4. For Slack integration, run `./debot/setup_slack_token.sh` to configure your Slack Bot token
5. Any remaining warnings should be significantly fewer and easier to address

## Maintenance Tips

- Use `let` instead of `var` for values that won't change
- Keep up with API changes in SwiftUI, especially as iOS versions evolve
- Always use dependency analysis for Run Script phases by declaring input and output files
- Avoid using `find` commands in your build scripts, as they can cause sandbox permission issues
- When naming assets, use unique names that won't conflict with system names
- Keep sensitive information like API tokens out of source control by using configuration files

All scripts created during this cleanup process are available in the project folder and can be reused if similar issues arise in the future.
