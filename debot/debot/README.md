## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- iOS 15.0+
- Xcode 13.0+
- Swift 5.5+
- CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/debot.git
cd debot
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pod install
# or
swift package resolve
```

3. Open the project:
```bash
open Debot.xcworkspace
```

4. Build and run the project on your device or simulator.

### API Configuration

Debot uses the AviationStack API for flight data. To use your own API key:

1. Sign up at [AviationStack](https://aviationstack.com/) to get an API key
2. Create a `Config.plist` file in the project root
3. Add your API key to the configuration file:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>AviationStackAPIKey</key>
    <string>YOUR_API_KEY</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

## Architecture

Debot follows a clean architecture approach with MVVM pattern:

```
Debot/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Models/           # Data models and structures
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Views/            # SwiftUI views and components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Components/   # Reusable UI components
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Screens/      # Main application screens
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ViewModels/       # Business logic and data transformation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Services/         # API and data services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Utilities/        # Helper functions and extensions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Resources/        # Assets and configuration files
```

### Key Components

- **AviationService**: Handles API communication with AviationStack
- **FlightSearchViewModel**: Manages flight search and results
- **FlightGlobeView**: Renders the 3D globe visualization
- **DebotPremiumAnimations**: Provides luxury animations and effects

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Themes

Debot offers three premium themes:

1. **Luxury Dark**: Rich, deep colors with gold accents
2. **Luxury Light**: Elegant cream and brown palette
3. **System**: Respects user's system preference with Debot styling

Themes can be switched in the app via the theme selector in the top-left corner.

### Demo Mode

When API limits are reached or for demonstration purposes, enable Demo Mode to use realistic sample data:

```swift
// Enable demo mode
viewModel.useMockData = true
```

### Custom Alerts

Set up custom flight alerts for important updates:

```swift
FlightAlertManager.shared.createAlert(for: flight, type: .departure, timeOffset: -60)
```

## Performance Optimization

Debot is optimized for performance in several ways:

1. **Memory Management**: 3D resources are loaded and unloaded as needed
2. **Efficient Networking**: Request batching and prioritization
3. **Background Processing**: Heavy tasks are performed in background threads
4. **Caching**: Intelligent caching reduces API calls and improves responsiveness
5. **Rendering Optimizations**: LOD (Level of Detail) for 3D objects based on distance
